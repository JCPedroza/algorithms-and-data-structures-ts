# Insertion Sort

## Write the Insertion Sort Algorithm

Write a function, `insertionSort`, that takes an array of `number`s as argument, and
returns either the sorted array in-place, or the sorted version of the array as a copy.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function insertionSort (nums: number[]): number[]
```

## Categories

- Polynomial (cuadratic) growth
- Comparison sort
- Stable
- In-Place
- Adaptive

## Time Complexity

### Comparisons

- Average: `O(n²)`
- Best: `O(n)`
- Worst: `O(n²)`

### Swaps

- Average: `O(n²)`
- Best: `O(1)`
- Worst: `O(n²)`

## Space Complexity

- Total: `O(n)`
- Auxiliary: `O(1)`
