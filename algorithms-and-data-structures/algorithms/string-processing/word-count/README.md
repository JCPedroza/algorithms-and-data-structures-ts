# Word Count

Write a function `wordCount` that takes a string `text` as argument, and returns
the number of words it contains.

Count as a word any sequence of alphanumeric characters. Count as alphanumeric any
character that is either a letter in the English alphabet, or a base 10 number.

Consider both white space and punctuation as word separators.

## Function Signature
